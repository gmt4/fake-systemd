# Fake Systemd

This is a fork from [kvaps/fake-systemd](https://github.com/kvaps/fake-systemd).

Simple bash script using start-stop-daemon, instead of using original systemctl + dbus + privileges + seccomp + x packages + conjunction of Mercury and Venus.

## Status 

This project is effectively unmaintained. I will do my best to shepherd pull requests, but cannot guarantee a prompt response and do not have bandwidth to address issues or add new features. Please let me know via an issue if you'd be interested in taking ownership of fake-systemd.

## Usage

The container will only compile start-stop-daemon and put the file in systemctl.
Build

    $ docker build -t ahmet2mir/fakesystemd .

Run interactive docker

    $ docker run --rm -it ahmet2mir/fakesystemd bash

Many thanks to Ahmet Demir [ahmet2mir](https://github.com/ahmet2mir) for many improvements and continue development this script.

`start-stop-daemon` is under public domain, see https://github.com/daleobrien/start-stop-daemon#notes

```
A rewrite of the original Debian's start-stop-daemon Perl script
in C (faster - it is executed many times during system startup).

Written by Marek Michalkiewicz <marekm@i17linuxb.ists.pwr.wroc.pl>,
public domain.  Based conceptually on start-stop-daemon.pl, by Ian
Jackson <ijackson@gnu.ai.mit.edu>.  May be used and distributed
freely for any purpose.  Changes by Christian Schwarz
<schwarz@monet.m.isar.de>, to make output conform to the Debian
Console Message Standard, also placed in public domain.  Minor
changes by Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org>, also placed in the Public
Domain.

Changes by Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>, added --chuid, --background
and --make-pidfile options, placed in public domain aswell.

Port to OpenBSD by Sontri Tomo Huynh <huynh.29@osu.edu>
               and Andreas Schuldei <andreas@schuldei.org>
Changes by Ian Jackson: added --retry (and associated rearrangements).

Modified for Gentoo rc-scripts by Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org>:
 I removed the BSD/Hurd/OtherOS stuff, added #include <stddef.h>
 and stuck in a #define VERSION "1.9.18".  Now it compiles without
 the whole automake/config.h dance.
